Improvements
    consumer.js
        - add option to unsubscribe from events

    eventManager.js    
        - add some error handling in case any of the input parameters are incorrect

    queriesManager.js
        - would be nice to add the option in the queries to put in a single object instead of an array and have it still work
        - add test where I pass in the wrong database, show the correct error

        getAssetStatusesByAssetIDs
            - add regular expression test to check if all the input_ids are valid
            - can't currently differentiate between user error or if it just doesn't exist in the database yet

Experiments
    - statuses_db: check if only storing assetID improves speed
    - statuses_db: check if using 3 separate arrays instead of 1 object with 3 arrays improves speed
